For this project (done as part of The Odin Project Foundations course), I initially needed to implement rock paper scissors in a way such that it is playable via the browser console when you open up the relevant webpage. Later in the course, after learning about event listeners and other things, I needed to apply the knowledge I'd gained to make the game playable via a GUI on the webpage itself.

The webpage works fairly well when using a modern version of google chrome or firefox on my 22â€³ 1920x1080 desktop monitor, and hopefully it will work OK for other web browsers and for desktop monitors of other sizes and resolutions (I haven't properly covered responsive web page design yet).

If the text is too small then make sure to zoom in!
