For this project (done as part of The Odin Project Foundations course), I needed to implement rock paper scissors in a way such that it is playable via the browser console when you open up the relevant webpage.

In a later lesson, I will need to add a GUI for the game with buttons and text, and I will update this README file after having done so.
